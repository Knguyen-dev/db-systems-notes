# Business Intelligence
Tools and processes used to capture, store, and analyze data. We do it to get and derive useful information from data (numbers and stats), and that information is used to make good business decisions.

## Benefits
- Easy user interface for reporting and analyzing data
- Common data repo that has a single version of company data
- Better performance for organization.
However creating a good business intelligence system takes a lot of time and effort.

## Extra terms 
- Decision support system: Arrangement of computerized tools used to assist in decision making. So this means the data is already cleaned, modified, organized, etc.

## Data warehouse
An integrated subject oriented, time variant, nonvolatile collection of data that provides support for decision making. 

## Online analytical processing (OLAP)
Business intelligence style where the systems have 3 main characteristics:
- Multidimensional data analysis techniques: Stuff such as advanced data presentation, aggregation, consolidation, classification functiosn. As well as this functionality to support advanced computations and data modeling.
- Advanced database support: Should be able to work with many different DBMSs, large databases, etc.
- Easy-to-use end-user interfaces

## Data Analytics
Subset of business intelligence that focues on math, statistisc, and modeling techniques all for analyzing data.
- Explanatory analytics: Analyzing existing data.
- Predictive analytics: Using existing data to try to predict future outcomes.

## Data Mining
Analyzing massive amounts of data ot uncover hidden trends, patterns, and relationships. This is done to form computer models, do simulations, get knowledge and support decision making. Here are the general steps:

### Data Preparation
- Identify, clean and integrate data.
### Data analysis and classification
- Classification, clustering and sequence, link, and finally trend and deviation analysis
### Knowledge and acquisition phase
- Select and apply algorithms. Use your neural networks, decision tree, regression tree, some idnuctive logic, and other techniques. Also doing data visualization.
### Prognosis phase
- Modeling, forecasting, and sprediction.
